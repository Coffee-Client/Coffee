# Adding a new feature
To add a new feature:
1. Clone this repository
2. Add your feature in your branch
3. Test the feature in game, to make sure it's bug free
4. Open a pull request, and wait for it to be reviewed

# Programming style and standards
I don't care about how you format the code as long as it works, I'm going to remake it at some point either way. Just make sure to use the java standard naming conventions, and you'll be fine.

# Defining a good feature
A good feature to add should not be present already under a different name, and should genuently be useful to the community. No one's going to use a discord raidbot implemented directly into a client (wink wink @Saturn5VFive).

Generally everything flies as long as it's a good idea and hasn't been implemented already.
