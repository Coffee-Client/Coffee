# Coffee client
A very based 1.18.2 client that was recently discontinued, now reuploaded and even better.

## Installing
### You will need
- Minecraft java
- Fabric mod loader

### How to install
1. Get the latest release from the `bin` folder in this repository
2. Drag it into your mods folder
3. Launch the game
## Using
The client is very easy to use, although the clickgui is **not** bound by default. Use `.bind ClickGUI` to bind the module.

Everything else is pretty self explanatory.
